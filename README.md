## 1-D Advection Model of Phosphorus Cycling in the Colorado River

### About the Model: 
This is a 1-D advection model that will attempt to show how phosphorus levels change in the Colorado River downstream of Lake Powell. Lake Powell retains many nutrients in its sediment in inlet regions and in some areas up to 2 to 3 meters of sediment accumulate each year. Thus, large amounts of phosphorus are retained in this sediment, which reduces downstream transport of the element up to 99% (Southwest Biological Science Center). These reductions in phosphorus that cause imbalance in nutrient levels can alter downstream ecosystems. 

The model outputs a figure that shows initial concentration of phosphorus in the Colorado River as a range of values, and a final concentration that shows how these values move due to river velocity and flatten over time. 


#### Inputs:


#### Outputs: 
A plot of phosphorus concentration vs distance that shows how phosphorus moves through the Colorado River throughout the Grand Canyon over time.
